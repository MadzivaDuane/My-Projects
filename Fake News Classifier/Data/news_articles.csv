1,"On May 31, 2020, the W24 news website published an article reporting that Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer arrested and criminally charged in the controversial in-custody death of George Floyd, had committed suicide in his prison cell.MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin committed suicide in his prison cell pending trial on third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges, the U.S media reported on Saturday.On Sunday, John Harrington, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, announced that Chauvin committed suicide after his arrest in his Minnesota jail cellThis report, attributed to Minneapolis CBS affiliate WCCO-TV, was false, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety made no such announcement, and neither WCCO nor any other legitimate news outlet reported that Chauvin had taken his own life.The only source reporting this information was w24n.com, a junk news site that has previously published numerous false claims, such as articles about Barack Obama‘s supposedly having tested positive for coronavirus, and North Korea’s allegedly having announced the death of leader Kim Jong-un.Chauvin was being held in Hennepin County Jail  before being transferred to Minnesota Correctional Facility  Oak Park Heights."
2,"On May 9, 2020, the BIZ News website published a story reporting that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., stated that it was “okay to eat pets” if food runs scarce. The story circulated on Facebook, prompting Snopes readers to ask whether Ocasio-Cortez, often called by her initials AOC, had really made the remark quoted in the headline: “If Food Runs Scarce, It’s Okay To Eat Pets.” The story also contained another purported quote from Ocasio-Cortez:
Ocasio-Cortez did not make these comments, which have not been quoted or referenced in any legitimate news sources. We therefore rate this claim false.
BIZ News is a junk news website with a track record of fabricating inflammatory quotes and attributing them to Democratic political figures, including a fake quote attributed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stating that senior citizens were “not entitled to Social Security.” "
3,"On March 8, 2020, the Tumblr pages “Wayne Radio TV” and “Piss Vortex” started spreading a rumor that 2020 presidential candidate and former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden had his staff bury a dog after it wandered on stage during a campaign event. While this crude rumor was unbelievable, it was accompanied by a set of manipulated images which appeared to show a Snopes article had rated the claim as “True.”Biden’s campaign did not bury a dog on stage during a rally and Snopes did not publish an article verifying that he did. This rumor and fact check were made up out of whole cloth. A reverse image search via TinEye showed that the photograph of the dog was originally published in 2015. The photograph shows a dog that was rescued in Russia after it was accidentally buried beneath pavement. Another reason to be suspicious of the veracity of these Tumblr images is that they were shared without a link back to the supposed article. Of course, there was no link to include because these screenshots refer to an article that simply doesn’t exist. After the above-displayed images went viral, the page posted a second graphic claiming that Biden had buried 937 dogs during the Democratic primary, compared to 0 dogs buried by Sen. Bernie SandersPurveyors of misinformation often present their ruses as if they originated with a credible news outlet. For instance, a hoax website may use a URL that closely resembles that of a genuine news outlet, as was the case with a fake presidential poll in 2016."
