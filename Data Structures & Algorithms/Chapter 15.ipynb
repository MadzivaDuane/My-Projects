    "* Computer memory is organized into a sequence of words, each of which typically consists of 4, 8, or 16 bytes (depending on the computer). These memory words are numbered from 0 to N −1, where N is the number of memory words available to the computer. The number associated with each memory word is known as its memory address\n",

    "* The designers of Python instead placed the burden of memory management entirely on the interpreter. The process of detecting “stale” objects, deallocating the space devoted to those objects, and returning the reclaimed space to the free list is known as garbage collection\n",
    "* Python principally uses 2 forms of garbage collction algorithms:\n",
    "    * Reference counts: Within the state of every Python object is an integer known as its reference count. This is the count of how many references to the object exist anywhere in the system. Every time a reference is assigned to this object, its reference count is incremented, and every time one of those references is reassigned to something else, the reference count for the former object is decremented\n",
    "    * Cycle detection: a more advanced method used to reclaim objects that are unreachable, despite their nonzero reference counts\n",
    "        * Mark sweep algorithm: reclaims unused space in time proportional to the number of live objects and their references plus the size of the memory heap"
