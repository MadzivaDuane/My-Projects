    "In this chapter, we introduce a data structure known as a linked list, which provides an alternative to an array-based sequence (such as a Python list). Both\n",
    "array-based sequences and linked lists keep elements in a certain order, but using a very different style. An array provides the more centralized representation, with one large chunk of memory capable of accommodating references to many elements. A linked list, in contrast, relies on a more distributed representation in which a lightweight object, known as a node, is allocated for each element. Each node maintains a reference to its element and one or more references to neighboring nodes in order to collectively represent the linear order of the sequence"

    "A singly linked list, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively form a linear sequence. Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list. The first and last node of a linked list are known as the head and tail of the list, respectively."
