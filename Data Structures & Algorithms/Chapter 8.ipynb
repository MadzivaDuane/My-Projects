    "\n",
    "* Trees are a non-linear data structure in computing which offer a richer organizational structure compared to the before & after structure offered by linear data structures such as lists\n",
    "* A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically\n",
    "* Two nodes that are children of the same parent are siblings. A node v is external if v has no children. A node v is internal if it has one or more children.External nodes are also known as leaves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordered Trees\n",
    "* A tree is ordered if there is a meaningful linear order among the children of each node; that is, we purposefully identify the children of a node as being the first, second, third, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Trees\n",
    "* A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:\n",
    "    * Every node has at most two children\n",
    "    * Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child\n",
    "    * A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node"
