    "## Binary Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary trees are an excellent data structure for storing items of a map, assuming we have an order relation defined on the keys\n",
    "* In this context, a binary search tree is a binary tree T with each position p storing a key-value pair (k,v) such that:\n",
    "    * Keys stored in the left subtree of p are less than k\n",
    "    * Keys stored in the right subtree of p are greater than k\n",
    "* The most important consequence of the structural property of a binary search tree is its namesake search algorithm. We can attempt to locate a particular key in a binary search tree by viewing it as a decision tree\n",

    "\n",
    "## Insertions & Deletions\n",
    "### Insertions\n",
    "* The map command M[k] = v, as supported by the setitem method, begins with a search for key k (assuming the map is nonempty). If found, that item’s existing value is reassigned. Otherwise, a node for the new item can be inserted into the underlying tree T in place of the empty subtree that was reached at the end of the failed search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deletions\n",
    "* Deleting an item from a binary search tree T is a bit more complex than inserting a new item because the location of the deletion might be anywhere in the tree\n",
    "    * Simplest case scenario is a node with 1 child - the node is deleted and replaced with its child\n",
    "    * Worst case scenario is a node with 2 children, its deletion would leave 2 orphaned children"

    "## Performance Of A Binary Tree\n",
    "* A binary search tree an efficient implementation of a map with n entries only if its height is small\n",
    "* If we could assume a random series of insertions and removals, the standard binary search tree supports O(logn) expected running times for the basic map operations. However, we may only claim O(n) worst-case time, because some sequences of operations may lead to an unbalanced tree with height proportional to n\n",
    "* In the remainder of this chapter, we explore four search tree algorithms that provide stronger performance guarantees. Three of the four data structures (AVL\n",
    "trees, splay trees, and red-black trees) are based on augmenting a standard binary search tree with occasional operations to reshape the tree and reduce its height\n",
    "    * The primary operation to rebalance a binary search tree is known as a rotation - during a rotation, we “rotate” a child to be above its parent"

    "* The primary operation to rebalance a binary search tree is known as a rotation. During a rotation, we rotate a child to be above its parent\n",

    "various operations is linear time, because it is possible that a series of operations results in a tree with linear height\n",
    "* Any binary search tree T that satisfies the height-balance property is said to be an AVL tree, named after the initials of its inventors: Adel’son-Vel’skii and Landis\n",

    "\n",
    "* A splay tree does not strictly enforce a logarithmic upper bound on the height of the tree. In fact, there are no additional height, balance, or other auxiliary data associated with the nodes of this tree\n",
    "* The efficiency of splay trees is due to a certain move-to-root operation, called splaying, that is performed at the bottommost position p reached during every insertion,\n",
    "deletion, or even a search\n",
    "* Intuitively, a splay operation causes more frequently accessed elements to remain nearer to the root, thereby reducing the typical search times. The surprising thing about splaying is that it allows us to guarantee a logarithmic amortized running time, for insertions, deletions, and searches"

    "operations (rotations) to be performed after a deletion, and (2,4) trees may require many split or fusing operations to be performed after an insertion or removal\n",
    "* A red-black tree is a binary search tree with nodes colored red and black in a way that satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "    * Root Property: The root is black.\n",
    "    * Red Property: The children of a red node (if any) are black.\n",
    "    * Depth Property: All nodes with zero or one children have the same black depth, defined as the number of black ancestors. (Recall that a node is its own\n",
